# Includes

## Description
The `Includes()` method determines whether the array includes a certain value among its entries, returning `True` or `False` as appropriate.

## Syntax

*expression*.**Includes**(*SearchElement*, [*FromIndex*])

### Parameters

Name
: `SearchElement`

Type
: `Variant`

Necessity
: Required

Description
: The value to search for.

---

Name
: `FromIndex`

Type
: `Long`

Necessity
: Optional

Description
: The position in this array at which to begin searching for `SearchElement`; the first character to be searched is found at `FromIndex` for positive values of `FromIndex`, or at the array's `Length` property + `FromIndex` for negative values of `FromIndex` (using the absolute value of `FromIndex` as the number of characters from the end of the array at which to start the search). Defaults to the array's `LowerBound` property.

---

Name
: `recurse`

Type
: `Boolean`

Necessity
: Optional

Description
: If the array is jagged (an array of arrays) or multidimensional (which are stored internally as jagged arrays) and you wish for all nested arrays to be checked then `recurse` must be true - otherwise only the outermost array will be checked. This argument has no effect when operating on a one-dimension array.


### Returns

Type
: `Boolean`

Description
: `True` if the array includes `SearchElement`, `False` if not.

## Example

```vb
Public Sub IncludesExample()
    Dim result As Boolean
    Dim MyArray As BetterArray
    Set MyArray = New BetterArray

    MyArray.Push "Foo", "Bar", "Fizz", "Buzz"
    result = MyArray.Includes("Bar")
    ' expected output:
    ' result is True
End Sub
```
